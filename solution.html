    <h2>Combined Virtual Simulation Tools</h2>
    <p>
      The proposed solution is the use of combined virtual simulation tools to teach
      agricultural and fishery machine operation. These simulations allow learners to
      explore how machines function without physically owning or operating real equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, a virtual tractor simulation can demonstrate how land is prepared,
      while a digital harvester simulation shows proper harvesting techniques. In fishery,
      simulations can present boat navigation and equipment handling.

    <h2>Poster-Based Learning Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Each virtual simulation is supported by an educational poster that explains the
      machine’s purpose, main parts, and real-life applications. Posters provide visual
      guidance that helps learners understand machines step by step.
    </p>
    <p>
      By combining posters and simulations, students gain both theoretical knowledge and
      practical understanding, even without direct access to costly machines.

    <h2>Application in Agriculture and Fishery Arts</h2>
    <p>
      This solution can be applied in classrooms, training centers, and community learning
      spaces. Students can develop confidence and skills through simulations before
      handling real machines when necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, learning becomes more accessible, safer, and less dependent on owning
      expensive agricultural equipment.
