  <h2>Combined Virtual Simulation Tools</h2>
  <p>
    Our solution is to combine virtual simulation tools with makerspace access.
    Students can practice operating tractors, food processors, and fishing equipment
    digitally before using real machines, which reduces costs and ensures safe
    learning.

  <h2>Poster</h2>
  <p>
    Each student can create a poster summarizing their learning from the
    virtual simulation. This encourages reflection, reinforces concepts,
    and allows teachers to assess understanding without requiring
    expensive equipment for every student.

    <h2>Poster</h2>
    <p>
      Each virtual tool can have a poster that explains how it works.
      Posters are simple, visual guides that make learning easier and
      more accessible, even without owning machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Posters also help teachers and communities share knowledge quickly.
      They combine text and images to make instructions clear and memorable.
