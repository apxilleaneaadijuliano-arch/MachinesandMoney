  <h2>🖥️ Combined Virtual Simulation Tools</h2>
  <div class="emoji">🧑‍💻</div>
  <p>
    Our proposed solution is to use combined virtual simulation tools to teach farming
    and fishery machine operations. These simulations allow users to experience how
    machines work without physically owning them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through digital simulations, learners can practice operating tractors, harvesters,
    food processors, and fishing equipment in a safe and controlled environment.

  <h2>🎨 Poster-Based Learning</h2>
  <div class="emoji">📊</div>
  <p>
    Each machine will be presented through an educational poster that explains its
    function, parts, and purpose. These posters are paired with virtual simulations
    to enhance understanding and engagement.
  </p>
  <p>
    This approach allows students and farmers to visualize machines clearly while
    developing skills without the pressure of handling costly equipment.

  <h2>🌾 Application in AFA</h2>
  <div class="emoji">🌽</div>
  <p>
    Virtual simulations and posters can be used in classrooms, training centers, and
    community learning spaces. This provides equal learning opportunities regardless
    of financial limitations.
  </p>
  <p>
    By focusing on skill development first, learners gain confidence before using real
    machines when necessary.
