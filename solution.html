            <h2>Combine Virtual Tools</h2>
            <p>Our solution is to combine virtual simulation tools with makerspace access. This lets students practice using machines virtually first, so they learn the skills without buying expensive equipment. They only use the real machines when needed. This saves money and helps more students learn efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Poster</h2>
            <p>Each virtual simulation tool will have a poster that explains how it works and shows important information. Posters make it easier to understand the machines and techniques without using them all the time.</p>
