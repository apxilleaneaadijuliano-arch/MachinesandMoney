  <h1>Our Solution</h1>
  <p>We believe the answer is to combine <strong>virtual simulation tools</strong> with <strong>makerspace access</strong>. This way, students and farmers can practice skills safely on computers first, and only use real machines when needed. This saves money and reduces risk.</p>

  <h2>Teacher’s Suggestion</h2>
  <p>Our teacher suggested making a <strong>poster</strong> to show how virtual simulation tools can be combined with makerspace access. This highlights the importance of learning safely and affordably before using real machines.</p>
