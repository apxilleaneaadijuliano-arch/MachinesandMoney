    <h2>About the Learning Area</h2>
    <p>
      Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA) teaches students practical skills in farming,
      fishing, and food processing. It helps students understand how machines are used
      in real agricultural systems.

      Machines like tractors, harvesters, and irrigation tools improve efficiency and
      allow students to experience hands-on skills for future real-life applications.

    <h2>Main Problem: High Cost of Machines</h2>
    <p>
      The high cost of machines in AFA affects Grade 8 students because schools often
      cannot provide enough equipment. Students rely on limited classroom resources,
      which reduces practical learning opportunities.
    </p>
    <img src="images/tractor.jpg" alt="Tractor" class="section-img">
    <p>
      This problem prevents students from fully understanding machine operation,
      which can reduce engagement, confidence, and skill development.
    </p>

    <h2>Root Cause Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The main cause is the high price of machines due to advanced technology, import
      fees, and maintenance costs. During our evaluation, we realized that asking for
      school partnerships to borrow machines may not be reliable.
    </p>

      Therefore, students need a realistic solution that allows learning without owning
      expensive machines while still practicing real-life skills.
