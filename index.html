            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>We chose Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA) because farming and fishing need machines. Machines help produce more, but they are very expensive. This website explains the problem and why it is hard for small farmers to afford these machines.</p>

            <h2>Root Cause Analysis (RCA)</h2>
            <p>The main problem is the high cost of machines. Tractors, harvesters, and fishing boats are very expensive, and farmers can't easily buy or maintain them. This makes farming harder, reduces income, and affects food supply. The root cause is advanced technology, import taxes, and lack of financial support for small farmers.</p>
