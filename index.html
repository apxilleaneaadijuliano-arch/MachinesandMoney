    <h2>Learning Area Selected</h2>
    <p>
      Agriculture and Fishery Arts focuses on real-world skills in farming, fishing,
      and food production. Machines play a vital role in improving efficiency and
      productivity within these industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the high cost of machines limits access for many farmers and fisherfolk,
      especially those in small-scale and rural communities.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Modern agriculture relies on tractors, harvesters, and processing machines.
      These tools reduce labor and increase output, but they require significant
      financial investment.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Main Problem</h2>
    <p>
      The unaffordability of machines prevents farmers from modernizing their work,
      leading to lower productivity and income.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Root Cause</h2>
    <p>
      Advanced technology, import costs, maintenance expenses, and lack of financial
      support all contribute to the high price of agricultural machines.
