    <h2>About the Learning Area</h2>
    <p>
      Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA) is a Technology and Livelihood Education (TLE)
      learning area that teaches students practical skills related to farming, fishing,
      food processing, and agricultural technology. It helps students understand how food
      is produced and how machines are used in real agricultural systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In AFA, machines such as tractors, harvesters, food processors, and farming tools
      are important because they improve efficiency and accuracy. Learning how these
      machines work prepares students for real-life applications and future livelihoods.

    <h2>Main Problem: High Cost of Machines</h2>
    <p>
      The main problem identified in this Root Cause Analysis is the high cost of machines
      used in Agriculture and Fishery Arts. These machines are expensive to buy, maintain,
      and repair, making them difficult to access in school settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Grade 8 students, we often learn about machines only through pictures, videos,
      or discussions. Due to limited school resources, students rarely experience actual
      machine operation, which affects hands-on learning and skill development.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Impact on Students</h2>
    <p>
      Because schools cannot always provide expensive agricultural machines, students
      struggle to fully understand how these tools work. Learning becomes more theoretical
      than practical, which reduces engagement and confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This situation limits students’ exposure to real-life agricultural practices and
      makes it harder for them to connect lessons to real-world applications in farming
      and fishery.
    </p>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Root Cause Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The root cause of this problem is the high market price of agricultural machines.
      Machines are costly due to advanced technology, importation fees, maintenance
      expenses, and limited availability.
    </p>
    <p>
      During our group evaluation, we realized that simply requesting access to machines
      through school partnerships may not be reliable, as such requests can be declined
      due to budget limitations. This made us understand the need for a more realistic and
      student-centered solution.
