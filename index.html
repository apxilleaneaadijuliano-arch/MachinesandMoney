    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Farming and fishing today depend on machines like tractors and boats.
      These tools make work faster, but they are very expensive. This site
      explains why the high cost of machines is a big challenge for small
      farmers and fisherfolk.

    <h2>Root Cause Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The main issue is unaffordability. Machines are costly because of
      manufacturing, import taxes, and lack of subsidies. Without support,
      farmers use older tools, which lowers productivity and income.
