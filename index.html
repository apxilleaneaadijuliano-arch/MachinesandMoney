    <h2>TLE Learning Area Selected</h2>
    <p>
      Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA) is a learning area that focuses on practical
      skills related to farming, fishing, food processing, and agricultural technology.
      It prepares students to understand real-life agricultural systems and how food is
      produced, processed, and distributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In modern AFA practices, machines such as tractors, harvesters, rice mills,
      irrigation systems, and fishing boats are essential. These machines help increase
      efficiency, reduce manual labor, and improve production quality.

    <h2>Background / Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, agriculture and fishery have become increasingly dependent on
      machinery. For example, tractors allow farmers to prepare large areas of land
      faster, while mechanical harvesters reduce crop loss and save time. In fishery,
      motorized boats and processing equipment help increase catch and preserve products.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, these machines are often expensive to purchase and maintain. Small-scale
      farmers and fisherfolk, especially in rural areas, struggle to access such
      technology, leading to unequal opportunities and slower development.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Problem</h2>
    <p>
      The main problem addressed in this RCA is the high cost of agricultural and fishery
      machines. Many farmers and fisherfolk cannot afford to buy equipment or pay for
      repairs, fuel, and spare parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this, they rely on manual labor or outdated tools, which lowers
      productivity, increases physical strain, and reduces income over time.
    </p>

    <h2>Root Cause Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The high cost of machines is caused by several factors, including advanced
      technology, importation expenses, high fuel prices, and costly maintenance.
      Many machines are imported, making them more expensive due to taxes and shipping
      fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the lack of financial support, subsidies, and shared access programs
      makes it difficult for small farmers to modernize their practices, slowing overall
      agricultural progress.
