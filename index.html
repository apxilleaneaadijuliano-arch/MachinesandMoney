    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Farming and fishing today depend on machines like tractors, harvesters, and boats.
      These tools make work faster and more productive, but they are very expensive.
      This site explains why the high cost of machines is a challenge for small farmers
      and fisherfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to help students and communities understand this issue in simple terms.
      By learning about the problem, we can think of creative solutions that make farming
      and fishing more fair and sustainable.

    <h2>Root Cause Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The main issue is unaffordability. Machines are costly because of manufacturing,
      import taxes, and lack of subsidies. Without support, farmers use older tools,
      which lowers productivity and income.
    </p>
    <p>
      This problem affects not only individual farmers but also food supply and
      community growth. Understanding the root causes helps us find practical
      solutions that can improve agriculture for everyone.
