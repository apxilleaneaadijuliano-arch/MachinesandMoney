  <h1>Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA)</h1>
  <h2>Root Cause Analysis: High Cost of Machines</h2>

  <p>We chose Agriculture and Fishery Arts because farming and fishing use a lot of machines. These machines help people work faster and produce more food. But the problem is, they are very expensive. Small farmers and fisherfolk cannot always afford them.</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Modern farming and fishing depend on tractors, harvesters, and boats. These tools make life easier, but their high price makes it hard for poor farmers to keep up. This creates unfairness and slows down progress in agriculture.</p>

  <h3>Main Problem</h3>
  <p>The big issue is that machines cost too much. Without them, farmers have to rely on old tools or manual labor. This means less food is produced and farmers earn less money.</p>

  <h3>Root Cause</h3>
  <p>Machines are expensive because they use advanced technology, are often imported, and need costly maintenance. Without help from the government or cheaper options, farmers struggle to get the tools they need.</p>
