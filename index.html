  <h2>Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA)</h2>
  <p>
    Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA) is a TLE learning area that focuses on
    developing students’ skills in farming, fishing, and food processing.
    It prepares students for real-life applications by teaching proper
    techniques, safety, and the use of machines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Machines play a major role in modern agriculture and fisheries.
    Through AFA, students learn how these machines improve efficiency,
    accuracy, and productivity in real-world settings.

  <h2>Main Problem: High Cost of Machines</h2>
  <p>
    The high cost of machines limits students’ opportunities to experience
    hands-on learning. Many schools cannot afford enough equipment, which
    causes students to rely mostly on theoretical lessons instead of actual
    machine operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a result, students may struggle to fully understand how machines
    work and how they are safely used in agricultural and fishery practices.

    <p>
      Examples of expensive machines include tractors, harvesters,
      food-processing equipment, irrigation systems, and fishing tools
      that are often unavailable for regular student use.

  <h2>Root Cause Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    The main root cause of this problem is the high market price of machines.
    These costs are influenced by advanced technology, import fees, and
    maintenance expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
    During our evaluation, our group realized that relying on school
    partnerships to borrow machines may not always be approved. This makes
    access to equipment uncertain and limits consistent learning for students.
