  <h2>Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA)</h2>
  <p>
    AFA is a TLE learning area that teaches students farming, fishing,
    and food-processing skills. These lessons rely on machines to help
    students understand real-world agricultural systems.

  <h2>Main Problem</h2>
  <p>
    The high cost of machines limits student exposure to real equipment.
    Schools often cannot afford enough machines, causing students to rely
    only on theory instead of hands-on learning.

      Examples include tractors, food processors, fishing tools,
      and irrigation machines that students rarely get to use.

  <h2>Root Cause Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    Machines are expensive due to advanced technology, import costs,
    and maintenance expenses. As Grade 8 students, our group realized
    that borrowing machines from partnerships may not always be approved,
    making learning access unreliable.
