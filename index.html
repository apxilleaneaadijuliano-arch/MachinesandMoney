  <h2>High Cost of Machines</h2>
  <p>We chose Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA) because it involves machinery in farming and fishing. Machines improve productivity but their high cost makes them difficult to afford, especially for small farmers.</p>

  <h3>Summary / Background</h3>
  <p>Modern farming and fishing rely heavily on machines like tractors, harvesters, and fishing boats. However, their high purchase and maintenance costs limit access for small-scale farmers. This creates inequality, reduces efficiency, and makes farming less sustainable.</p>

  <h3>Main Problem</h3>
  <p>The central issue is the unaffordability of modern machines. Farmers and fisherfolk cannot easily buy or maintain equipment, which leads to reduced efficiency and higher production costs.</p>

  <h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>
  <p>Machines are costly due to advanced technology, importation, and maintenance expenses. Without government subsidies, cooperative ownership, or affordable financing, farmers struggle to access modern tools.</p>
