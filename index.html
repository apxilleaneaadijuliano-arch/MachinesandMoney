  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA) is a TLE learning area that teaches
    students practical skills in farming, fishing, and food processing.
    Modern agriculture relies heavily on machines, but these are expensive,
    limiting students' hands-on experience and learning opportunities.

  <h2>Root Cause Analysis (High Cost of Machines)</h2>
  <p>
    The high cost of machines prevents students from using them regularly.
    Advanced technology, import fees, and maintenance make equipment
    unaffordable for schools. As a result, students often learn only the
    theory, not the practical skills needed to operate machinery safely
    and effectively.

    <h2>Root Cause Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      The main issue is unaffordability. Machines are costly because of manufacturing,
      import taxes, and lack of subsidies. Without support, farmers use older tools,
      which lowers productivity and income.
    </p>
    <p>
      This problem affects not only individual farmers but also food supply and
      community growth. Understanding the root causes helps us find practical
      solutions that can improve agriculture for everyone.
