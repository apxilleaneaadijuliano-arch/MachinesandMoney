  <h2>⚙️ TLE Learning Area Selected</h2>
  <p>
    Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA) relies on machines such as tractors, harvesters,
    and fishing equipment. While these machines improve productivity, their high cost
    makes them inaccessible to small farmers and fisherfolk.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>📈 Background</h2>
  <p>
    Modern farming and fishing depend on machinery to save time and labor. However,
    expensive purchase prices and maintenance costs limit access, creating inequality
    and lowering efficiency in agricultural communities.

  <h2>💸 Main Problem</h2>
  <p>
    The main problem is the unaffordability of modern machines. Farmers and fisherfolk
    struggle to buy or maintain equipment, resulting in higher production costs and
    lower income.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>🔧 Root Cause</h2>
  <p>
    Machines are expensive due to advanced technology, import taxes, lack of subsidies,
    and high maintenance costs. Without financial support or shared access, farmers
    are forced to rely on outdated tools.
