  <h2>⚙️ TLE Learning Area Selected</h2>
  <div class="emoji">🚜</div>
  <p>
    Agriculture and Fishery Arts (AFA) focuses on farming and fishing skills that depend
    heavily on machines such as tractors, harvesters, processing tools, and fishing
    equipment. These machines help increase productivity, save time, and reduce physical
    labor.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, despite their importance, many farmers and fisherfolk cannot afford these
    machines. This makes learning, production, and sustainability difficult—especially
    for small-scale communities.

  <h2>📈 Background / Summary</h2>
  <div class="emoji">🌱</div>
  <p>
    Modern agriculture and fishery have evolved to rely on advanced machines for planting,
    harvesting, food processing, and preservation. These machines improve efficiency and
    food quality, but they come with high purchase and maintenance costs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of this, small farmers are often left behind, forced to rely on manual labor
    and outdated tools, which leads to lower productivity and unequal opportunities.

  <h2>💸 Main Problem</h2>
  <div class="emoji">💰</div>
  <p>
    The central problem is the high cost of agricultural and fishery machines. Farmers and
    fisherfolk struggle to buy, repair, or maintain equipment, which increases production
    costs and limits income.
  </p>
  <p>
    This problem affects not only individuals but also food supply, economic growth, and
    sustainability in agricultural communities.

  <h2>🔧 Root Cause Analysis</h2>
  <div class="emoji">🛠️</div>
  <p>
    Machines are expensive because of advanced technology, importation fees, high fuel
    costs, and maintenance expenses. Many machines are imported, making them even more
    costly for local farmers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The lack of financial support, affordable alternatives, and shared access systems
    forces farmers to continue using inefficient tools, slowing progress in agriculture
    and fishery.
